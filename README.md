A tiny shell written in Python with full suport for external shell commands and pipes. It features auto-completion on internally available commands and directory contents.  Several linux utilities have already been implemented (and renamed for namespace reasons), e.g., `info, files, delete, copy, where, down, up, finish, source, help, hostname, username, dirname`
