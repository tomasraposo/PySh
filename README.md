## pysh, a bashwards compatible shell
\><(((\'>

A tiny shell written in Python with full suport for bash external commands and pipes. It features auto-completion on internally available coomands and directory contents.  Several linux utilities have already been reimplemented (and renamed for namespace reasonds), e.g., `info, files, delete, copy, where, down, up, finish, source, help, hostname, username, dirname`

* IO Redirection
